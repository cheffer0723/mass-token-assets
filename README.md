# Critical Mass (MASS)

Critical Mass (MASS) is an experimental ERC-20 token deployed on the Base network. The project explores how shared ownership, transparency, and long-term participation can create collective momentum (“critical mass”) in decentralized systems.

MASS is not a meme token, does not promise financial returns, and is not affiliated with any centralized entity. The project is intended for experimentation, documentation, and community-driven exploration of on-chain coordination and governance concepts.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of Critical Mass is to study and demonstrate how decentralized communities form, coordinate, and persist over time using simple, transparent on-chain primitives. The project prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and long-term experimentation over short-term speculation.
