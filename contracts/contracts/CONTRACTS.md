# Contracts

This project was deployed using thirdweb’s prebuilt ERC20 contract on Base Mainnet.

Because this is a thirdweb prebuilt implementation, the deployed contract is a parameterized instance of thirdweb’s audited ERC20 code.

## Live Contract
- Network: Base Mainnet
- Token: Critical Mass (MASS)
- Contract Address: (0x7a500D8A14CeeC2c9155aBF2657D072E132C9a1A)

## Notes
- Source verification should be completed on the block explorer (if applicable).
- This repository documents the deployment, token assets, and configuration for transparency.
